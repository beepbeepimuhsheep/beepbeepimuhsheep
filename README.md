- 👋 Hey, I'm a not-too-shabby Software Developer! I'm still a student but on the verge of entering the real world.
- 👀 I'm interested in finding out more about the developer community, what it's like being a developer,
- 🌱 best practices to keep a healthy balanced life as a developer, and just the overall lifestyle really.
- 💞️ I'd like to immerse myself in the field more and really dive into the mind-set.
- 📫 I have plans for my career but am still learning the ins and outs and the details of the career itself.
